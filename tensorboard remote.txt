You can port-forward with another ssh command that need not be tied to how you are connecting to the server
(as an alternative to the other answer). Thus, the ordering of the below steps is arbitrary.

From your local machine, run

ssh -N -f -L localhost:16006:localhost:6006 <user@remote>

On the remote machine, run:

tensorboard --logdir <path> --port 6006

Then, navigate to (in this example) http://localhost:16006 on your local machine.

(explanation of ssh command:

-N : no remote commands

-f : put ssh in the background

-L <machine1>:<portA>:<machine2>:<portB> :

forward <machine1>:<portA> (local scope) to <machine2>:<portB> (remote scope)
